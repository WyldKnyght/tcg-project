## Introduction

The TCG project is a machine learning model for predicting outcomes of matches between two decks in the Pokemon Trading Card Game. With this tool, users can tailor their decks to specific conditions and get a calculated prediction of the match outcome beforehand.

This guide will cover the main features of the project, how to set it up, and how to use it effectively. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started, or an experienced player looking to optimize your gameplay, this guide has everything you need to know.


## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

* **Error: No module named <module name>**: This error occurs when a required module is not installed. To fix this error, install the missing module using the command `pip install <module name>`.

* **Error: Invalid version string**: This error occurs when you try to install a version of a package that doesn't exist. Check the available versions of the package using the command `pip search <package name>`, and choose a version that exists.

* **Error: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement <package name>**: This error can occur when you try to install a package with an incorrect name. Make sure that the package name is spelled correctly and exactly matches the name on the package's PyPI page.

* **Error: Unable to import a package**: This error can occur when you have multiple versions of a package installed. To fix this error, uninstall all versions of the package using `pip uninstall <package name>`, and then reinstall the correct version using `pip install <package name>==<version>`.

If you encounter any other issues, please feel free to create an issue on the project's Github page.
