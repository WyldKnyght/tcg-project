Premium subscriptions
This section covers our terms regarding premium subscriptions.

Billing: We'll automatically bill you on each periodic renewal until cancelation. We'll send you an email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date.

Cancelation: You may cancel your subscription at any time. Canceled subscriptions remain active until the end of the billing cycle (the period you paid for), unless your account is terminated. Canceled subscriptions can be reactivated without any charge (before they have expired). Refunds are only issued if required by law.

Changing your billing plan: You may change your billing plan to a longer period (e.g., from monthly to yearly), but not the other way around. The cost of the remaining time of your billing plan will be subtracted from the cost of your new billing plan. If you want to change your billing plan to a shorter period, you will have to cancel your subscription and wait until it has expired before starting a new subscription with the shorter billing plan.

Price changes: We may change subscription prices to reflect factors such as changes to our business, or changes in economic conditions. We'll give you no less than 30 days advance notice of these changes by email, and you'll have the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new prices comes into effect.
