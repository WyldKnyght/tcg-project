# Running Tests for the TCG Project

To run tests for the TCG project, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the TCG project repository using the `cd` command.

2. Install the required testing packages using pip:

```
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

3. Run the tests using the following command:

```
$ pytest
```

This will run all of the tests in the project and output the results to the terminal. In general, you should see a message indicating that all tests have passed. If you see any error or failure messages, this indicates that something is wrong with the project code, and you should investigate the issue further.
